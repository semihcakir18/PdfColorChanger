# What To Do Next - PDF Color Scheme Converter

This document outlines the remaining issues and future improvements needed for the PDF Color Scheme Converter project.

## = Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Figures and Images Handling
**Problem**: The current implementation completely removes all figures, images, graphics, charts, and visual elements from PDFs during conversion.

**Required Fix**:
- Preserve ALL non-text elements (images, figures, charts, diagrams, logos, etc.)
- These elements should remain EXACTLY as they are in the original PDF
- Even if they look odd against the new background color, they must be preserved
- Graphics positioning and sizing should be maintained precisely

**Impact**: High - Many PDFs (especially CVs, reports, presentations) contain important visual elements that are currently lost.

### 2. Text Layout Issues
**Problem**: There are still minor text positioning and spacing issues causing occasional overlapping or misaligned text.

**Symptoms**:
- Some lines may overlap slightly
- Text spacing inconsistencies
- Potential line height issues
- Minor positioning errors

**Required Fix**:
- Improve text positioning accuracy
- Better line spacing preservation
- Enhanced layout detection and recreation
- More robust text block handling

**Impact**: Medium - Affects readability and professional appearance

### 3. Turkish Character Display
**Problem**: Turkish characters (ç, , 1, ö, _, ü, Ç, 0, , Ö, ^, Ü) are displaying as placeholder symbols (flying dots "·") instead of the correct characters.

**Current Status**: 
- Characters are extracted correctly from PDF (Unicode values confirmed)
- Issue occurs during text insertion back into new PDF
- PyMuPDF's `insert_text()` function cannot handle Turkish Unicode characters properly

**Required Fix**:
- Implement proper Unicode handling for Turkish characters
- May require alternative text insertion methods
- Could need font embedding or character encoding solutions

**Broader Scope**: This likely affects other non-Latin alphabets:
- Arabic script ('D91(J))
- Cyrillic script ( CAA:89)
- Greek script (•»»·½¹º¬)
- Asian scripts (-‡, å,ž, \m´)
- Other Latin-based scripts with diacritics

**Impact**: High - Affects international users and multilingual documents

## <¯ Priority Order

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix figures/images preservation
   - Essential for document integrity
   - Affects most real-world PDFs

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Resolve text layout issues  
   - Important for readability
   - Affects user experience

3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix Turkish/International character support
   - Critical for international users
   - Currently makes the tool unusable for non-English documents

## =¡ Technical Approach Suggestions

### For Images/Figures:
- Extract and preserve all graphic elements separately
- Use PyMuPDF's image detection capabilities
- Maintain original positioning and scaling
- Consider layering approach: background ’ images ’ text

### For Layout Issues:
- Implement more sophisticated text block detection
- Use PyMuPDF's text line grouping features
- Consider preserving original text positioning more precisely
- Test with various PDF types and layouts

### For Character Encoding:
- Research alternative text insertion methods in PyMuPDF
- Investigate font embedding solutions
- Consider using different PDF manipulation libraries for text
- Test with various international character sets

## >ê Testing Requirements

Once fixes are implemented, test with:
- PDFs containing images, charts, and graphics
- Documents with complex layouts (tables, columns, etc.)
- Turkish documents with all special characters
- International documents (Arabic, Chinese, Russian, etc.)
- Mixed-content PDFs (text + images + special characters)

## =È Future Enhancements (After Core Fixes)

- Custom color scheme creation
- Batch processing multiple PDFs
- Font preservation options
- Advanced image handling (recoloring, transparency)
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Better preview functionality
- Undo/redo capabilities
